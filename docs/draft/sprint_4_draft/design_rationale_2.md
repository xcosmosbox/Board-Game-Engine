### 4.2  Explain why you have revised the architecture, if you have revised it. (What has changed would have been shown in the revised class diagram. This one is about why it changed)

We did not modify the schema. We still use the original architecture. Although we added a new interface, this interface inherits from PlayerModel Interface. Therefore, from a polymorphic perspective, it still belongs to the PlayerModel Interface. This is indeed the case. Although we have added an interface, in all the codes in Sprint3, we still maintain all type declarations, parameter types received by functions, etc., using PlayerModel Interface as the interactive interface. Another strong evidence that can prove that we have not modified the architecture is that we have not made any changes to the functional code implemented in Sprint3, and we have perfectly implemented the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
